expression = 3 + 6 * (5 + 4) / 3 - 7
# Step-by-step evaluation:
# 1. Parentheses: 5 + 4 = 9
# 2. Expression becomes: 3 + 6 * 9 / 3 - 7
# 3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): 6 * 9 = 54
# 4. Expression becomes: 3 + 54 / 3 - 7
# 5. Division: 54 / 3 = 18
# 6. Expression becomes: 3 + 18 - 7
# 7. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): 3 + 18 = 21
# 8. Expression becomes: 21 - 7
# 9. Subtraction: 21 - 7 = 14

result = 3 + 6 * (5 + 4) / 3 - 7
print(result)  # Output: 14
